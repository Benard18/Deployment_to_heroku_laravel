# Deployment_to_heroku_laravel


## Introduction
Welcome to a series of Deploying a Laravel Application.

Laravel applications are deployed many sites.

I will show you how to deploy an application which has a database and to be specific, Postgresql Database.

## Prequisities
+ PHP (and ideally some Laravel) knowledge.
+ A Heroku user account: [SignUp is free and instant](https://signup.heroku.com/signup/dc)
+ Familiarity with [getting started with PHP on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php) guide, with the following things installed:
		1.PHP.
		2.Composer.
		3.Heroku CLI.

<!-- ### Heroku CLI
To have complete success, we would need the Heroku CLI in our local machine.

To do that we need to run this set of commands in our command-line which will be found [here](https://cli.heroku.com/). -->
